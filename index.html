  <h3 class="text-centered">A little about me...</h3>

	<p class="text-centered"> I am from San Antonio, Texas and still reside in Central Texas with my girlfriend, our two dogs, and a little man on the way! I am an avid gamer and enjoy keeping up with the NBA.</p>
 
  




	<h3 class="text-centered">How I got started...</h3>

	<p>Growing up, I always had a knack for problem solving with computers and naturally gravitated towards Computer Science in college. When I had to take a break from my studies, I began working as a Robotics Technician for Amazon. While I loved working with my hands and problem solving technical issues on the robotics floor, I really wanted to continue my path that I started in college. As time went by, I became more and more inclined to advance my career path and take on the journey to becoming a software dev! Growing up around various computer and gaming systems, computer programming has always my dream, and I'm excited to dive further into the field.</p>
	<p class="text-centered">As a student at Thinkful, I've begun my journey to becoming a software dev, and I couldn't be happier!</p>
